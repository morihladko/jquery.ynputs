jQuery plugins for customizable html inputs [select and checkbox].

At one time we needed to customize a html select and checkboxes. I couldn't find any nice JS solution to this, so I wrote my own. After a while we needed to reuse it. So I rewrote it to these jquery plugins. 

# TODO write something more
